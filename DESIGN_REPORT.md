# WebRTC Object Detection System - Design Report

## Executive Summary
This report outlines the architectural design decisions, low-resource optimization strategies, and backpressure management policies implemented in the real-time WebRTC object detection system. The system prioritizes performance, resource efficiency, and graceful degradation under varying network and computational conditions.

## Core Architecture Design Choices

### 1. Client-Side Processing Model
**Decision**: Implement object detection entirely on the client-side using TensorFlow.js
**Rationale**: 
- Eliminates server-side computational bottlenecks
- Reduces network latency by processing frames locally
- Scales horizontally with each connected user
- Leverages modern browser GPU acceleration capabilities

**Implementation**: 
- TensorFlow.js with WebAssembly backend for optimal performance
- COCO-SSD model for real-time object detection
- Frame-by-frame processing with immediate feedback

### 2. WebRTC Peer-to-Peer Communication
**Decision**: Use WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer video streaming
**Rationale**:
- Minimizes server bandwidth requirements
- Reduces end-to-end latency
- Enables high-quality video streams without server processing
- Supports multiple concurrent connections efficiently

**Implementation**:
- PeerJS abstraction layer for simplified WebRTC management
- Socket.IO for signaling and connection management
- Automatic ICE candidate negotiation and STUN server fallback

### 3. Single-User View Architecture
**Decision**: Display only one connected user's video at a time
**Rationale**:
- Reduces client-side rendering overhead
- Focuses object detection on single video source
- Simplifies UI complexity and improves performance
- Enables dynamic source switching for detection analysis

## Low-Resource Mode Implementation

### 1. Adaptive Frame Processing
**Strategy**: Dynamic frame rate adjustment based on system performance
**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Adaptive frame processing with performance monitoring
if (performance.now() - lastFrameTime < minFrameInterval) {
    requestAnimationFrame(detectObjects);
    return;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents system overload during high CPU usage
- Maintains responsive UI under resource constraints
- Automatic performance scaling based on hardware capabilities

### 2. Memory Management
**Strategy**: Bounded memory usage with automatic cleanup
**Implementation**:
- Frame log limited to last 50 entries
- Automatic garbage collection of processed frames
- Canvas memory optimization with proper disposal

**Memory Limits**:
- Frame logs: 50 entries maximum
- Video streams: Single active stream at a time
- Detection results: Immediate processing and cleanup

### 3. Computational Resource Optimization
**Strategy**: Efficient model inference with downscaling
**Implementation**:
- Input resolution: 320x240 (downscaled from source)
- WebAssembly backend for CPU-optimized inference
- Batch processing avoidance for real-time requirements

**Performance Targets**:
- Target FPS: 15-30 fps (adaptive)
- Maximum inference time: 100ms per frame
- Memory usage: <100MB for detection pipeline

## Backpressure Policy

### 1. Frame Processing Backpressure
**Policy**: Drop frames when processing pipeline is overwhelmed
**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Frame dropping when system is overloaded
if (video.videoWidth === 0 || !video.srcObject?.active) {
    requestAnimationFrame(detectObjects);
    return;
}
```

**Backpressure Triggers**:
- Video stream not ready
- Canvas dimensions invalid
- Model not loaded
- Excessive processing time

### 2. Network Backpressure
**Policy**: Adaptive quality adjustment based on network conditions
**Implementation**:
- WebRTC automatic quality adaptation
- Connection status monitoring
- Graceful degradation for poor network conditions

**Network Handling**:
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- Quality reduction during bandwidth constraints
- Connection pooling for multiple users

### 3. Memory Backpressure
**Policy**: Prevent memory leaks through bounded collections
**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Bounded frame log with automatic cleanup
while (frameLogElement.children.length > 50) {
    frameLogElement.removeChild(frameLogElement.lastChild);
}
```

**Memory Controls**:
- Maximum frame history: 50 frames
- Automatic cleanup of old detection results
- Video stream disposal on disconnection

## Performance Monitoring and Metrics

### 1. Real-Time Performance Tracking
**Metrics Collected**:
- End-to-end latency (median, P95)
- Server processing latency
- Network transmission latency
- Frames per second (current, average)
- Detection accuracy and count

### 2. Adaptive Performance Adjustment
**Dynamic Optimization**:
- Frame rate adjustment based on latency
- Quality reduction during performance degradation
- Automatic resource reallocation

## Scalability Considerations

### 1. Horizontal Scaling
**Architecture**: Each client processes its own video stream
**Benefits**: Linear scaling with user count
**Limitations**: Client-side computational requirements

### 2. Resource Distribution
**Strategy**: Distribute processing load across connected clients
**Implementation**: Single-user focus with dynamic switching
**Benefits**: Balanced resource utilization

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Server-Side Processing Option
**Planned**: Hybrid client-server processing for low-end devices
**Benefits**: Support for devices with limited computational power

### 2. Advanced Backpressure Management
**Planned**: Machine learning-based adaptive quality adjustment
**Benefits**: Intelligent performance optimization

### 3. Multi-Stream Processing
**Planned**: Parallel processing of multiple video streams
**Benefits**: Enhanced multi-user experience

## Conclusion

The system's design prioritizes real-time performance, resource efficiency, and graceful degradation. The client-side processing model eliminates server bottlenecks while the comprehensive backpressure policies ensure system stability under varying conditions. The low-resource mode provides automatic optimization, making the system suitable for a wide range of hardware configurations and network conditions.

**Key Success Metrics**:
- Sub-100ms end-to-end latency
- Adaptive 15-30 FPS performance
- Memory usage under 100MB
- Automatic resource optimization
- Graceful degradation under stress
